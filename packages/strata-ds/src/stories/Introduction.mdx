# White Label Design System

Welcome to the White Label Design System documentation. This system is designed to be token-based, allowing for easy theming and whitelabeling.

## Architecture

- **Tokens**: The foundation of the system. Valid for both light and dark modes.
- **Components**: Built using React and Tailwind CSS, consuming tokens via CSS variables.

## Getting Started

To use this design system in your project:

```bash
npm install strata-ds-whitelabel
```
