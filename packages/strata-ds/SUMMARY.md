# Strata Design System - Progress Snapshot Jan 23, 2026

## Updates
- **Brand System Retrofit:**
    - Applied the "Brand-300 Light / Brand-500 Dark" design token rule to the Catalyst implementation.
    - Consistent Glassmorphism: Ensured all Navbar dropdowns use the standard `backdrop-blur-xl` and `bg-white/90` (dark: `bg-zinc-900/90`) rules.
- **Accessibility:**
    - Verified text contrast on high-vibrancy Brand backgrounds.

## Next Steps for Monday
- Port the refined "Action Center" and "My Apps" interaction logic back to Strata core if applicable.
- Finalize the data visualization palette tokens.
